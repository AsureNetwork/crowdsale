## Bug Bounty Program
To minimize risk and identify potential vectors of attack we launched a bug bounty program before the
Crowdsale begins. The bug bounty payouts for hackers will focus on major attacks:
Gaining access to ETH or ERC20 tokens in locking contracts; 
Breaking the smart-contracts, either by passing a decision or draining its funds against a majority function.
